00:00:04.652 --> 00:00:06.681
There was a raven
from King's Landing.

00:00:06.956 --> 00:00:09.758
<v Mary>No way!Jon Arryn is dead.

00:00:09.793 --> 00:00:11.727
<i>The King rides</i>
<i>for Winterfell</i>

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:14.229
<i>with the Queen</i>
<i>and all the rest of them.</i>

00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:16.331
<i>The Queen</i>
<i>has two brothers?</i>

00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:19.701
There's the pretty one,
and there's the clever one.

00:00:19.736 --> 00:00:21.870
I would name you
the Hand of the King.

00:00:21.905 --> 00:00:23.639
We were meant
to rule together.

00:00:23.673 --> 00:00:28.143
<i>I have a son, you have a daughter.</i>
<i>We'll join our houses.</i>

00:00:28.178 --> 00:00:30.879
The boy I beheaded--
he was talking madness.

00:00:30.914 --> 00:00:32.948
Said the others
slaughtered his friends.

00:00:32.982 --> 00:00:35.551
- Ned: A Wildling ambush.
- Maybe.

00:00:35.585 --> 00:00:36.961
You're Tyrion Lannister.

00:00:36.986 --> 00:00:39.279
You-- you're Ned Stark's
bastard, aren't you?

00:00:39.522 --> 00:00:41.590
Let me give you
some advice, bastard.

00:00:41.624 --> 00:00:44.793
Never forget what you are and it
can never be used to hurt you.

00:00:44.828 --> 00:00:46.389
It's a direwolf.

00:00:46.414 --> 00:00:48.136
There are no direwolves
south of the wall.

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:51.066
Now there are five, one for
each of the Stark children.

00:00:51.101 --> 00:00:53.168
- What about you?
- I'm not a Stark.

00:00:53.203 --> 00:00:56.004
That one's yours, Snow.

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.641
May I present Viserys
of House Targaryen,

00:00:59.676 --> 00:01:01.376
the rightful King
of the Andals,

00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:03.645
<i>and his sister Daenerys?</i>

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.582
I don't want to be his queen.
I want to go home.

00:01:06.616 --> 00:01:11.687
<i>We go home with an army--</i>
<i>with Khal Drogo's army.</i>

00:01:11.721 --> 00:01:13.075
From your sister.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.092
She says Jon Arryn was
murdered by the Lannisters.

00:01:16.192 --> 00:01:18.427
She says the King
is in danger.

00:01:18.461 --> 00:01:20.295
What if Jon Arryn
told someone?

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.398
Whatever Jon Arryn knew
died with him.

00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:29.771
The things I do for love.

You need to drink, child.

00:03:46.782 --> 00:03:48.983
And eat.

00:03:52.587 --> 00:03:54.955
Isn't there
anything else?

00:03:56.124 --> 00:03:58.626
The Dothraki have two things
in abundance:

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.430
Grass and horses.
People can't live on grass.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.108
<i>In the Shadow Lands</i>
<i>beyond Asshai,</i>

00:04:14.142 --> 00:04:16.510
<i>they say there are</i>
<i>fields of ghost grass</i>

00:04:16.578 --> 00:04:19.680
with stalks as pale as milk
that glow in the night.

00:04:19.714 --> 00:04:22.349
It murders
all other grass.

00:04:22.384 --> 00:04:24.852
The Dothraki believe
that one day

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.122
it will cover everything--
that's the way the world will end.

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:43.170
It'll get easier.

00:05:21.276 --> 00:05:21.308
Khaleesi!

00:05:22.777 --> 00:05:24.745
Your hands.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.925
We're still not far
from Pentos, your Grace.

00:05:37.993 --> 00:05:40.427
Magister Illyrio has
extended his hospitality.

00:05:40.495 --> 00:05:42.496
You'd be more
comfortable there.

00:05:42.531 --> 00:05:44.932
I have no interest
in hospitality or comfort.

00:05:44.966 --> 00:05:47.434
I'll stay with Drogo
until he fulfills

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:49.770
his end of the bargain
and I have my crown.

00:05:49.838 --> 00:05:52.173
As you wish, your Grace.

00:05:53.341 --> 00:05:55.409
Well, Mormont,
as brutish as this life is,

00:05:55.443 --> 00:05:57.845
I suppose it is preferable
to beheading.

00:05:59.381 --> 00:06:01.615
What did Ned Stark
want you for?

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.617
Buying from a slaver?

00:06:03.685 --> 00:06:06.453
Selling to one--

00:06:06.521 --> 00:06:08.956
some poachers I caught
on my land.

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:13.694
Under my reign, you won't be
punished for such nonsense.

00:06:13.728 --> 00:06:16.063
You can rest assured
of that.

00:06:40.822 --> 00:06:43.657
Better-looking bitches
than you're used to, Uncle.

00:06:47.596 --> 00:06:50.197
My mother's been
looking for you.

00:06:50.232 --> 00:06:52.600
We ride for
King's Landing today.

00:06:52.634 --> 00:06:55.736
Before you go, you will call
on Lord and Lady Stark

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.838
and offer
your sympathies.

00:06:57.872 --> 00:07:00.808
What good will
my sympathies do them?

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.346
None. But it is
expected of you.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.481
Your absence has
already been noted.

00:07:07.515 --> 00:07:09.650
The boy means
nothing to me.

00:07:09.684 --> 00:07:12.119
And I can't stand
the wailing of women.

00:07:14.289 --> 00:07:16.190
One word and I'll
hit you again.

00:07:16.224 --> 00:07:17.992
I'm telling mother!

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.462
Go!
Tell her.

00:07:21.496 --> 00:07:23.597
But first you will get
to Lord and Lady Stark

00:07:23.632 --> 00:07:25.633
and you will fall on your knees
in front of them

00:07:25.667 --> 00:07:28.502
and tell them how very sorry you are,
that you are at their service,

00:07:28.536 --> 00:07:32.006
and that all your prayers are with them.
Do you understand?

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.208
You can't--

00:07:34.242 --> 00:07:35.809
Do you understand?

00:07:42.617 --> 00:07:44.785
The prince will
remember that, little lord.

00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:46.820
I hope so.

00:07:46.855 --> 00:07:50.357
If he forgets, be a good dog
and remind him.

00:07:53.094 --> 00:07:56.230
Ah.
Time for breakfast.

00:08:03.271 --> 00:08:06.407
Bread.
And two of those little fish.

00:08:06.474 --> 00:08:09.877
And a mug of dark beer
to wash it down.

00:08:12.447 --> 00:08:14.515
And bacon,
burned black.

00:08:14.549 --> 00:08:16.517
Hyah.

00:08:16.551 --> 00:08:19.553
- Little brother.
- Beloved siblings.

00:08:23.925 --> 00:08:25.926
Is Bran going to die?

00:08:27.729 --> 00:08:29.830
Apparently not.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.602
- What do you mean?
- The Maester says the boy may live.

00:08:43.678 --> 00:08:46.747
It's no mercy, letting a child
linger in such pain.

00:08:46.781 --> 00:08:48.549
Only the gods
know for certain.

00:08:48.583 --> 00:08:51.118
All the rest of us
can do is pray.

00:08:52.554 --> 00:08:55.122
The charms of the north
seem entirely lost on you.

00:08:55.156 --> 00:08:57.091
I still can't believe
you're going.

00:08:57.125 --> 00:08:59.126
It's ridiculous
even for you.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.894
Where's your sense
of wonder?

00:09:00.929 --> 00:09:05.132
The greatest structure ever built,
the intrepid men of The Night's Watch,

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.735
the wintry abode
of the White Walkers.

00:09:07.769 --> 00:09:10.704
Tell me you're not thinking
of taking the black.

00:09:10.739 --> 00:09:13.640
And go celibate?
The whores would go begging

00:09:13.675 --> 00:09:15.776
from Dorne to Casterly Rock.

00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:17.778
No, I just want to stand
on top of the wall

00:09:17.812 --> 00:09:19.913
and piss off
the edge of the world.

00:09:21.316 --> 00:09:23.984
The children don't need
to hear your filth.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:27.654
Come.

00:09:33.762 --> 00:09:37.175
Even if the boy lives,
he'll be a cripple, a grotesque.

00:09:37.176 --> 00:09:40.362
Give me a good
clean death any day.

00:09:41.569 --> 00:09:44.838
Speaking for the grotesques,
I'd have to disagree.

00:09:44.906 --> 00:09:48.108
Death is so final,
whereas life...

00:09:48.143 --> 00:09:50.144
Ah, life is full
of possibilities.

00:09:51.546 --> 00:09:53.046
I hope the boy does wake.

00:09:53.081 --> 00:09:55.682
I'd be very interested
to hear what he has to say.

00:09:58.186 --> 00:10:00.053
My dear brother,

00:10:00.088 --> 00:10:02.756
there are times you make me
wonder whose side you're on.

00:10:02.791 --> 00:10:05.125
<i>My</i> dear brother,
you wound me.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.728
You know how much
I love my family.

00:10:26.948 --> 00:10:28.182
Please.

00:10:28.216 --> 00:10:31.618
Oh, I would have
dressed, your Grace.

00:10:31.653 --> 00:10:34.121
This is your home.
I'm your guest.

00:10:37.292 --> 00:10:39.326
Handsome one, isn't he?

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:44.164
I lost my first boy,
a little black-haired beauty.

00:10:44.199 --> 00:10:47.301
He was a fighter too--

00:10:47.335 --> 00:10:50.671
tried to beat the fever
that took him.

00:10:50.738 --> 00:10:52.973
Forgive me.

00:10:53.007 --> 00:10:55.008
It's the last thing you
need to hear right now.

00:10:55.043 --> 00:10:57.277
I never knew.

00:10:57.312 --> 00:10:59.146
It was years ago.

00:11:00.715 --> 00:11:03.684
Robert was crazed, beat
his hands bloody on the wall,

00:11:03.751 --> 00:11:07.588
all the things men do to show
you how much they care.

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.661
The boy looked
just like him.

00:11:16.331 --> 00:11:19.032
Such a little thing...

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.935
A bird without feathers.

00:11:24.105 --> 00:11:28.942
They came to take his body away
and Robert held me.

00:11:28.943 --> 00:11:31.076
I screamed and I battled,
but he held me.

00:11:36.317 --> 00:11:38.318
That little bundle.

00:11:40.121 --> 00:11:42.589
They took him away
and I never saw him again.

00:11:42.624 --> 00:11:44.958
Never have visited
the crypt, never.

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:57.604
I pray to the mother
every morning and night

00:11:57.639 --> 00:11:59.873
that she return
your child to you.

00:12:01.843 --> 00:12:03.544
I am grateful.

00:12:03.578 --> 00:12:06.647
Perhaps this time
she'll listen.

00:12:57.699 --> 00:12:59.733
A sword for the wall?

00:13:01.869 --> 00:13:04.471
- I already have one.
- Good man.

00:13:04.505 --> 00:13:07.708
- Have you swung it yet?
- Of course I have.

00:13:07.742 --> 00:13:09.376
At someone, I mean.

00:13:13.948 --> 00:13:17.050
It's a strange thing,
the first time you cut a man.

00:13:17.085 --> 00:13:20.253
You realize we're nothing
but sacks of meat

00:13:20.288 --> 00:13:23.724
and blood and some bone
to keep it all standing.

00:13:25.927 --> 00:13:28.095
Let me thank you
ahead of time

00:13:28.129 --> 00:13:30.964
for guarding us all from
the perils beyond the wall--

00:13:30.999 --> 00:13:33.600
Wildlings and White Walkers
and whatnot.

00:13:35.737 --> 00:13:37.371
We're grateful to have

00:13:37.405 --> 00:13:39.773
good, strong men like you
protecting us.

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:45.078
We've guarded the kingdoms
for 8,000 years.

00:13:47.749 --> 00:13:50.283
Is it "we" already?

00:13:51.819 --> 00:13:53.487
Have you taken
your vows then?

00:13:53.521 --> 00:13:54.788
Soon enough.

00:13:57.091 --> 00:13:59.359
Give my regards
to The Night's Watch.

00:13:59.394 --> 00:14:02.829
I'm sure it will be thrilling
to serve in such an elite force.

00:14:02.864 --> 00:14:04.798
And if not?

00:14:04.832 --> 00:14:07.701
It's only for life.

00:14:26.387 --> 00:14:28.455
Thank you, Nymeria.

00:14:35.163 --> 00:14:38.131
Septa Mordane says
I have to do it again.

00:14:38.166 --> 00:14:40.801
My things weren't
properly folded, she says.

00:14:40.835 --> 00:14:42.574
Who cares how they're folded?!

00:14:42.575 --> 00:14:44.000
They're going to get all
messed up anyway.

00:14:45.207 --> 00:14:46.373
It's good
you've got help.

00:14:46.374 --> 00:14:48.208
Watch.

00:14:48.242 --> 00:14:50.143
Nymeria, gloves.

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:58.251
- Impressive.
- Shut up.

00:14:58.286 --> 00:15:00.887
Nymeria, gloves!

00:15:02.223 --> 00:15:04.758
I have something for you.

00:15:04.792 --> 00:15:07.127
And it has to be packed
very carefully.

00:15:07.161 --> 00:15:08.962
A present?

00:15:08.996 --> 00:15:11.098
Close the door.

00:15:23.478 --> 00:15:25.946
This is no toy.

00:15:28.583 --> 00:15:31.451
Be careful you don't
cut yourself.

00:15:34.188 --> 00:15:36.356
- It's so skinny.
- So are you.

00:15:37.592 --> 00:15:39.459
I had the blacksmith
make it for you special.

00:15:39.494 --> 00:15:40.961
<i>It won't hack</i>
<i>a man's head off,</i>

00:15:40.995 --> 00:15:43.130
but it can poke him full
of holes if you're quick enough.

00:15:43.164 --> 00:15:44.201
I can be quick.

00:15:44.226 --> 00:15:45.922
You'll have to work
at it every day.

00:15:47.101 --> 00:15:48.535
How does it feel?

00:15:48.569 --> 00:15:51.238
Do you like
the balance?

00:15:51.272 --> 00:15:53.440
I think so.

00:15:54.809 --> 00:15:57.277
First lesson: Stick them
with the pointy end.

00:15:57.311 --> 00:15:59.346
I know which end to use.

00:16:04.819 --> 00:16:06.887
I'm going to miss you.

00:16:08.456 --> 00:16:09.890
Careful.

00:16:21.102 --> 00:16:24.037
All the best swords
have names, you know.

00:16:26.774 --> 00:16:29.409
Sansa can keep
her sewing needles.

00:16:30.878 --> 00:16:33.013
I've got a needle
of my own.

00:16:47.728 --> 00:16:49.830
I came to say
goodbye to Bran.

00:16:49.864 --> 00:16:51.598
You've said it.

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:05.345
I wish I could be here
when you wake up.

00:17:08.316 --> 00:17:10.851
I'm going north
with Uncle Benjen.

00:17:10.885 --> 00:17:12.652
I'm taking the black.

00:17:21.562 --> 00:17:24.297
I know we always talked about
seeing the wall together,

00:17:24.332 --> 00:17:28.201
but you'll be able to come visit me
at Castle Black when you're better.

00:17:30.037 --> 00:17:32.372
I'll know my way
around by then.

00:17:32.406 --> 00:17:35.175
I'll be a sworn brother
of The Night's Watch.

00:17:40.248 --> 00:17:43.283
We can go out walking beyond the wall,
if you're not afraid.

00:17:57.899 --> 00:18:00.133
I want you

00:18:00.201 --> 00:18:01.801
to leave.

00:19:02.129 --> 00:19:04.297
17 years ago

00:19:04.332 --> 00:19:06.499
you rode off
with Robert Baratheon.

00:19:08.703 --> 00:19:12.038
You came back a year later with
another woman's son.

00:19:13.507 --> 00:19:16.209
And now
you're leaving again.

00:19:18.879 --> 00:19:20.647
I have no choice.

00:19:20.681 --> 00:19:24.551
That's what men always say
when honor calls.

00:19:24.585 --> 00:19:28.154
That's what you tell your families,
tell yourselves.

00:19:29.724 --> 00:19:32.058
You do have a choice.

00:19:32.093 --> 00:19:34.861
And you've made it.

00:19:37.999 --> 00:19:40.033
Cat--

00:19:45.706 --> 00:19:48.408
I can't do it, Ned.

00:19:51.379 --> 00:19:54.581
- I really can't.
- You can.

00:19:56.884 --> 00:19:58.685
You must.

00:20:22.109 --> 00:20:24.644
You've said
goodbye to Bran?

00:20:24.678 --> 00:20:27.113
He's not going to die.
I know it.

00:20:27.148 --> 00:20:29.449
You Starks
are hard to kill.

00:20:30.351 --> 00:20:32.052
My mother?

00:20:32.086 --> 00:20:34.554
- She was very kind.
- Good.

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:38.558
Next time I see you,
you'll be all in black.

00:20:38.592 --> 00:20:40.760
It was always my color.

00:20:41.962 --> 00:20:45.098
- Farewell, Snow.
- And you, Stark.

00:21:37.551 --> 00:21:40.086
There's great honor serving
in The Night's Watch.

00:21:42.123 --> 00:21:45.558
<i>The Starks have manned the wall</i>
<i>for thousands of years.</i>

00:21:45.593 --> 00:21:48.561
And you are a Stark.

00:21:48.596 --> 00:21:50.830
You might not have my name,

00:21:50.898 --> 00:21:52.999
but you have my blood.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.741
Is my mother alive?

00:22:01.775 --> 00:22:04.978
Does she know about me?
Where I am, where I'm going?

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.681
Does she care?

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:12.152
The next time
we see each other,

00:22:12.186 --> 00:22:14.521
we'll talk
about your mother.

00:22:14.555 --> 00:22:16.422
Huh?

00:22:16.457 --> 00:22:18.525
I promise.

00:22:58.132 --> 00:23:01.134
Gods, this is country!

00:23:02.903 --> 00:23:06.472
I've half a mind to leave them
all behind and keep going.

00:23:08.609 --> 00:23:10.910
I've half a mind
to go with you.

00:23:10.945 --> 00:23:12.979
What do you say,
just you and me

00:23:13.013 --> 00:23:15.548
on the Kingsroad,
swords at our sides,

00:23:15.583 --> 00:23:19.152
a couple of tavern wenches
to warm our beds tonight.

00:23:19.186 --> 00:23:21.854
You should have
asked me 20 years ago.

00:23:21.889 --> 00:23:24.757
There were wars to fight,
women to marry--

00:23:24.792 --> 00:23:26.859
we never had the chance
to be young.

00:23:26.894 --> 00:23:28.895
I recall
a few chances.

00:23:32.766 --> 00:23:35.435
There was that one...
Oh, what was her name?

00:23:35.469 --> 00:23:37.437
That common girl of yours?

00:23:37.471 --> 00:23:40.273
Becca? With the great big tits
you could bury your face in.

00:23:40.341 --> 00:23:42.642
Bessie.
She was one of yours.

00:23:42.676 --> 00:23:46.312
Bessie!
Thank the gods for Bessie

00:23:46.347 --> 00:23:49.182
and her tits.

00:23:49.216 --> 00:23:51.618
Yours was... Aleena?

00:23:51.652 --> 00:23:54.721
No. You told me once.
Meryl?

00:23:54.755 --> 00:23:56.789
Your bastard's mother?

00:23:58.425 --> 00:24:00.693
- Wylla.
- <i>That's it.</i>

00:24:00.728 --> 00:24:02.895
<i>She must have been</i>
<i>a rare wench</i>

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:05.765
to make Lord Eddard Stark
forget his honor.

00:24:05.799 --> 00:24:08.034
You never told me
what she looked like.

00:24:08.068 --> 00:24:10.436
Nor will I.

00:24:12.906 --> 00:24:14.774
We were at war.

00:24:14.808 --> 00:24:17.477
<i>None of us knew if we were</i>
<i>gonna go back home again.</i>

00:24:17.511 --> 00:24:20.980
You're too hard on yourself.
You always have been.

00:24:22.883 --> 00:24:26.085
I swear if I weren't your King,
you'd have hit me already.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:29.155
The worst thing
about your coronation--

00:24:29.223 --> 00:24:31.758
I'll never get
to hit you again.

00:24:33.927 --> 00:24:36.496
Trust me, that's not
the worst thing.

00:24:40.467 --> 00:24:42.502
There was a rider
in the night.

00:24:48.575 --> 00:24:52.078
Daenerys Targaryen has wed
some Dothraki horselord.

00:24:52.112 --> 00:24:54.781
What of it?
Should we send her a wedding gift?

00:24:54.815 --> 00:24:56.516
A knife perhaps,
a good sharp one,

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:58.484
and a bold man to wield it.

00:24:58.552 --> 00:25:00.486
She's little more
than a child.

00:25:00.521 --> 00:25:03.756
Soon enough that child will spread
her legs and start breeding.

00:25:03.791 --> 00:25:07.460
- Tell me we're not speaking of this.
- Oh, it's unspeakable to you?

00:25:07.494 --> 00:25:11.364
<i>What her father did to your family--</i>
<i>that was unspeakable.</i>

00:25:11.398 --> 00:25:13.466
What Rhaegar Targaryen
did to your sister--

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.635
<i>the woman I loved.</i>

00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:18.938
I'll kill every Targaryen
I get my hands on.

00:25:18.972 --> 00:25:21.174
But you can't get
your hands on this one, can you?

00:25:21.208 --> 00:25:23.142
This Khal Drogo,

00:25:23.177 --> 00:25:25.511
it's said he has 100,000 men
in his horde.

00:25:25.546 --> 00:25:28.314
Even a million Dothraki
are no threat to the realm,

00:25:28.349 --> 00:25:31.150
as long as they remain on the
other side of the Narrow Sea.

00:25:31.185 --> 00:25:33.152
They have no ships,
Robert.

00:25:33.187 --> 00:25:36.356
There are still those in the
Seven Kingdoms who call me usurper.

00:25:37.891 --> 00:25:41.160
If the Targaryen boy crosses
with a Dothraki horde at his back,

00:25:41.195 --> 00:25:43.996
- the scum will join him.
- He will not cross.

00:25:45.699 --> 00:25:48.868
And if by chance he does,
we'll throw him back into the sea.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.742
There's a war coming, Ned.

00:25:55.776 --> 00:25:57.610
<i>I don't know when,</i>

00:25:57.644 --> 00:26:00.179
I don't know who
we'll be fighting,

00:26:00.214 --> 00:26:01.714
but it's coming.

00:27:13.454 --> 00:27:15.354
Sit.

00:27:15.389 --> 00:27:17.390
You'll be fed.

00:27:20.694 --> 00:27:23.062
<i>Untie them.</i>

00:27:23.096 --> 00:27:26.566
Ah, rapers.

00:27:28.602 --> 00:27:32.405
They were given a choice no doubt--
castration or the wall.

00:27:32.473 --> 00:27:34.874
Most choose the knife.

00:27:39.513 --> 00:27:42.415
Not impressed
by your new brothers?

00:27:45.118 --> 00:27:47.053
<i>Lovely thing</i>
<i>about the watch--</i>

00:27:47.087 --> 00:27:50.590
you discard your old family
and get a whole new one.

00:27:59.266 --> 00:28:01.434
Why do you read so much?

00:28:01.468 --> 00:28:04.737
Look at me and tell me
what you see.

00:28:05.906 --> 00:28:07.773
Is this a trick?

00:28:07.841 --> 00:28:11.544
What you see is a dwarf.

00:28:11.578 --> 00:28:15.014
If I'd been born a peasant they might've
left me out in the woods to die.

00:28:15.048 --> 00:28:18.851
Alas, I was born a Lannister
of Casterly Rock.

00:28:18.886 --> 00:28:21.420
Things are expected of me.

00:28:21.455 --> 00:28:23.890
My father was the Hand
of the King for 20 years.

00:28:23.924 --> 00:28:26.125
Until your brother
killed that King.

00:28:31.632 --> 00:28:35.601
Yes, until my brother
killed him.

00:28:37.504 --> 00:28:40.139
<i>Life is full of these</i>
<i>little ironies.</i>

00:28:41.341 --> 00:28:43.309
My sister married
the new King

00:28:43.343 --> 00:28:46.546
and my repulsive nephew
will be King after him.

00:28:49.149 --> 00:28:52.451
I must do my part for the honor
of my house, wouldn't you agree?

00:28:54.154 --> 00:28:56.088
<i>But how?</i>

00:28:56.123 --> 00:28:58.925
Well, my brother
has his sword

00:28:58.959 --> 00:29:00.826
and I have my mind.

00:29:00.894 --> 00:29:04.196
And a mind needs books
like a sword needs a whetstone.

00:29:04.231 --> 00:29:07.333
That's why I read
so much, Jon Snow.

00:29:10.671 --> 00:29:13.139
And you?

00:29:13.173 --> 00:29:15.508
What's your story,
bastard?

00:29:17.711 --> 00:29:20.713
Ask me nicely and maybe
I'll tell you, dwarf.

00:29:24.484 --> 00:29:27.453
A bastard boy
with nothing to inherit,

00:29:27.487 --> 00:29:29.422
<i>off to join</i>

00:29:29.456 --> 00:29:31.924
<i>the ancient order</i>
<i>of The Night's Watch,</i>

00:29:31.959 --> 00:29:35.928
alongside his Valiant
brothers-in-arms.

00:29:35.963 --> 00:29:38.030
The Night's Watch protects
the realm from--

00:29:38.065 --> 00:29:41.300
ah, yes yes, against grumpkins
and snarks

00:29:41.335 --> 00:29:44.770
and all the other monsters
your wet nurse warned you about.

00:29:44.805 --> 00:29:47.173
<i>You're a smart boy.</i>

00:29:47.207 --> 00:29:49.809
You don't believe
that nonsense.

00:29:57.150 --> 00:30:00.286
Everything's better
with some wine in the belly.

00:30:34.688 --> 00:30:38.557
It's time we reviewed
the accounts, my lady.

00:30:38.625 --> 00:30:42.728
You'll want to know how much
this royal visit has cost us.

00:30:44.297 --> 00:30:46.899
Talk to Poole about it.

00:30:48.235 --> 00:30:51.337
Poole went south
with Lord Stark, my lady.

00:30:51.371 --> 00:30:54.073
<i>We need a new steward,</i>

00:30:54.107 --> 00:30:57.276
and there are several other
appointments that require

00:30:57.310 --> 00:31:01.414
- our immediate attention--
- I don't care about appointments!

00:31:02.716 --> 00:31:04.583
I'll make the appointments.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.235
We'll talk about it
first thing in the morning.

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:11.460
Very good, my Lord.

00:31:13.694 --> 00:31:15.327
My Lady.

00:31:28.208 --> 00:31:30.409
When was the last time
you left this room?

00:31:30.444 --> 00:31:33.079
I have to take care
of him.

00:31:33.113 --> 00:31:34.980
He's not going
to die, mother.

00:31:34.981 --> 00:31:37.192
Maester Luwin says the most
dangerous time has passed.

00:31:37.193 --> 00:31:38.559
<i>What if he's wrong?</i>

00:31:38.655 --> 00:31:42.359
- Bran needs me.
- <i>Rickon needs you.</i>

00:31:42.422 --> 00:31:44.356
He's six.

00:31:44.391 --> 00:31:47.793
He doesn't know what's happening.
He follows me around all day,

00:31:47.828 --> 00:31:50.262
- clutching my leg, crying--
- close the windows!

00:31:50.297 --> 00:31:52.465
I can't stand it!
Please make them stop!

00:31:56.169 --> 00:31:58.671
Fire.

00:31:58.705 --> 00:32:00.873
You stay here.
I'll come back.

00:32:18.592 --> 00:32:21.093
You're not supposed
to be here.

00:32:21.128 --> 00:32:23.829
No one is
supposed to be here.

00:32:23.897 --> 00:32:27.466
It's a mercy.
He's dead already.

00:32:30.137 --> 00:32:32.838
No!

00:33:38.572 --> 00:33:42.341
- Have you ever seen a dragon?
- Dragon gone, Khaleesi.

00:33:42.375 --> 00:33:45.411
<i>Everywhere?</i>
<i>Even in the east?</i>

00:33:45.445 --> 00:33:48.380
<i>No dragon.</i>
<i>Brave men kill them.</i>

00:33:48.415 --> 00:33:51.617
- <i>It is known.</i>
- It is known.

00:33:51.651 --> 00:33:55.688
A trader from Garth told me
that dragons come from the moon.

00:33:55.722 --> 00:33:58.057
The moon?

00:33:58.124 --> 00:34:00.292
He told me the moon
was an egg, Khaleesi,

00:34:00.327 --> 00:34:03.362
<i>that once there were</i>
<i>two moons in the sky.</i>

00:34:03.396 --> 00:34:07.233
But one wandered too close
to the sun and it cracked from the heat.

00:34:07.267 --> 00:34:10.502
Out of it poured a thousand
thousand dragons

00:34:10.537 --> 00:34:12.471
and they drank
the sun's fire.

00:34:12.505 --> 00:34:15.407
Moon is no egg.

00:34:15.442 --> 00:34:18.277
Moon is goddess--
wife of sun.

00:34:18.311 --> 00:34:21.080
- It is known.
- It is known.

00:34:22.616 --> 00:34:24.583
Leave me with her.

00:34:32.425 --> 00:34:35.694
Why did the trader from Garth
tell you these stories?

00:34:35.729 --> 00:34:38.931
Men like to talk
when they're happy.

00:34:38.965 --> 00:34:41.000
Before your brother
bought me for you,

00:34:41.034 --> 00:34:43.102
it was my job
to make men happy.

00:34:43.169 --> 00:34:46.338
- How old were you?
- I was nine

00:34:46.373 --> 00:34:48.374
when my mother sold me
to the pleasure house.

00:34:48.408 --> 00:34:49.909
Nine?!

00:34:49.943 --> 00:34:53.379
I did not touch a man
for three years, Khaleesi.

00:34:53.413 --> 00:34:54.947
First

00:34:54.981 --> 00:34:56.949
you must learn.

00:34:59.786 --> 00:35:03.289
Can you teach me how
to make the Khal happy?

00:35:04.491 --> 00:35:08.394
- Yes.
- Will it take three years?

00:35:09.796 --> 00:35:11.463
No.

00:35:32.919 --> 00:35:35.120
Welcome.

00:37:05.512 --> 00:37:09.081
What I am about to tell
you must remain between us.

00:37:10.583 --> 00:37:13.218
I don't think Bran
fell from that tower.

00:37:14.421 --> 00:37:16.422
I think he was thrown.

00:37:17.757 --> 00:37:20.526
The boy was always
sure-footed before.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:23.295
Someone tried
to kill him twice.

00:37:23.329 --> 00:37:26.432
<i>Why?</i>
<i>Why murder an innocent child?</i>

00:37:26.466 --> 00:37:29.201
Unless he saw something
he wasn't meant to see.

00:37:29.235 --> 00:37:31.937
- Saw what, my lady?
- I don't know.

00:37:33.506 --> 00:37:35.741
<i>But I would stake my life</i>
<i>the Lannisters are involved.</i>

00:37:35.775 --> 00:37:39.211
We already have reason
to suspect their loyalty to the crown.

00:37:39.245 --> 00:37:41.547
Did you notice the dagger
the killer used?

00:37:41.581 --> 00:37:44.016
It's too fine a weapon
for such a man.

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:47.352
The blade is Valyrian steel,
the handle dragonbone.

00:37:47.387 --> 00:37:49.288
Someone gave it to him.

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:54.226
They come into our home
and try to murder my brother?

00:37:54.260 --> 00:37:56.481
If it's war they want--

00:37:56.506 --> 00:37:58.194
If it comes to that, you know
I'll stand behind you.

00:37:58.198 --> 00:38:01.066
What, is there going to be
a battle in the Godswood?

00:38:01.101 --> 00:38:03.068
<i>Huh?</i>

00:38:03.103 --> 00:38:06.071
Too easily words of war
become acts of war.

00:38:06.106 --> 00:38:08.140
<i>We don't know</i>
<i>the truth yet.</i>

00:38:08.208 --> 00:38:10.742
Lord Stark
must be told of this.

00:38:10.777 --> 00:38:13.712
I don't trust a raven
to carry these words.

00:38:13.746 --> 00:38:15.647
- I'll ride to King's Landing.
- No.

00:38:15.682 --> 00:38:18.984
There must always be
a Stark in Winterfell.

00:38:19.018 --> 00:38:21.320
- I will go myself.
- Mother, you can't.

00:38:21.387 --> 00:38:23.522
I must.

00:38:23.556 --> 00:38:26.258
I'll send hal with a squad
of guardsmen to escort you.

00:38:26.292 --> 00:38:28.794
Too large a party attracts
unwanted attention.

00:38:28.828 --> 00:38:31.130
I don't want the Lannisters
to know I'm coming.

00:38:31.164 --> 00:38:32.998
Let me accompany you
at least.

00:38:33.032 --> 00:38:35.934
<i>The Kingsroad can be a</i>
<i>dangerous place for a woman alone.</i>

00:38:39.672 --> 00:38:42.007
What about Bran?

00:38:43.543 --> 00:38:46.645
I have prayed to the seven
for more than a month.

00:38:47.814 --> 00:38:51.183
<i>Bran's life is</i>
<i>in their hands now.</i>

00:39:49.876 --> 00:39:52.144
No, Khaleesi.

00:39:52.178 --> 00:39:54.980
You must look
in his eyes always.

00:39:55.014 --> 00:39:57.049
Love comes in at the eyes.

00:39:57.083 --> 00:40:01.520
It is said that Irogenia of Lys
could finish a man

00:40:01.554 --> 00:40:03.589
with nothing
but her eyes.

00:40:03.623 --> 00:40:05.924
Finish a man?

00:40:07.427 --> 00:40:09.528
Oh.

00:40:09.562 --> 00:40:14.099
Kings traveled across
the world for a night with Irogenia.

00:40:14.133 --> 00:40:16.768
Magisters sold
their palaces.

00:40:16.803 --> 00:40:20.539
<i>Khals burned her enemies</i>
<i>just to have her for a few hours.</i>

00:40:20.573 --> 00:40:24.343
They say a thousand men
proposed to her

00:40:24.377 --> 00:40:27.212
and she refused them all.

00:40:27.247 --> 00:40:30.816
Well, she sounds like
an interesting woman.

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:32.784
I-- I don't think

00:40:32.819 --> 00:40:35.087
that Drogo will like it
with me on top.

00:40:35.121 --> 00:40:37.623
You will make him
like it, Khaleesi.

00:40:37.657 --> 00:40:39.891
Men want what
they've never had.

00:40:39.926 --> 00:40:43.128
And the Dothraki take slaves
like a hound takes a bitch.

00:40:43.162 --> 00:40:46.632
Are you a slave,
Khaleesi?

00:40:57.243 --> 00:41:00.112
Then don't make love
like a slave.

00:41:08.488 --> 00:41:10.856
Very good, Khaleesi.

00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:13.058
Out there
he is the mighty Khal,

00:41:13.092 --> 00:41:17.162
<i>but in this tent,</i>
<i>he belongs to you.</i>

00:41:17.196 --> 00:41:19.431
I-- I don't think

00:41:19.465 --> 00:41:21.533
that this is
the Dothraki way.

00:41:21.567 --> 00:41:24.136
If he wanted
the Dothraki way,

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:27.172
why did he marry you?

00:42:15.621 --> 00:42:18.490
No.

00:42:20.893 --> 00:42:22.794
No!

00:42:22.829 --> 00:42:27.499
<i>Ajjalan anha zalat</i>
<i>vitiherat yer hatif.</i>

00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:15.774
Pardon me, Ser.

00:44:19.612 --> 00:44:21.947
Do I frighten you
so much, girl?

00:44:23.649 --> 00:44:26.418
Or is it him there
making you shake?

00:44:26.452 --> 00:44:29.054
He frightens
me too.

00:44:29.088 --> 00:44:31.556
Look at
that face.

00:44:31.591 --> 00:44:34.359
I'm sorry
if I offended you, Ser.

00:44:40.967 --> 00:44:42.935
Why won't he speak to me?

00:44:42.936 --> 00:44:45.136
He hasn't been very talkative
these last 20 years.

00:44:45.137 --> 00:44:48.206
Since the mad King had his tongue
ripped out with hot pincers.

00:44:48.241 --> 00:44:50.976
He speaks damn well
with his sword though.

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:54.779
Ser Ilyn Payne,
the King's justice.

00:44:56.282 --> 00:44:58.416
The royal
executioner.

00:44:59.719 --> 00:45:02.888
What is it, sweet lady?

00:45:04.457 --> 00:45:06.525
Does the hound frighten you?

00:45:06.559 --> 00:45:08.260
Away with you, dog.

00:45:08.294 --> 00:45:10.962
You're scaring
my lady.

00:45:13.165 --> 00:45:15.300
I don't like
to see you upset.

00:45:17.803 --> 00:45:19.604
The Sun is finally shining.

00:45:19.639 --> 00:45:21.406
Come walk with me.

00:45:23.342 --> 00:45:25.477
Stay, lady.

00:45:42.128 --> 00:45:44.329
I probably shouldn't
have any more.

00:45:44.363 --> 00:45:46.731
Father only lets us
have one cup at feasts.

00:45:46.766 --> 00:45:49.834
My princess can drink
as much as she wants.

00:46:02.248 --> 00:46:05.016
Don't worry--
you're safe with me.

00:46:06.018 --> 00:46:08.119
I'll get you!

00:46:13.292 --> 00:46:16.227
- Arya!
- Ow!

00:46:16.262 --> 00:46:17.829
What are you doing here?

00:46:17.863 --> 00:46:20.332
- Go away.
- Your sister?

00:46:24.070 --> 00:46:26.871
- And who are you, boy?
- Mycah, my Lord.

00:46:26.906 --> 00:46:29.007
- He the butcher's boy.
- He's my friend.

00:46:29.041 --> 00:46:32.510
A butcher's boy who wants
to be a Knight, eh?

00:46:34.113 --> 00:46:36.948
Pick up your sword, butcher's boy.
Let's see how good you are.

00:46:36.983 --> 00:46:39.584
She asked me to, my Lord.
She asked me to.

00:46:39.619 --> 00:46:41.586
I'm your prince,

00:46:41.621 --> 00:46:43.555
not your lord,

00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:47.192
and I said pick up
your sword.

00:46:47.259 --> 00:46:49.594
It's not a sword, my prince.
It's only a stick.

00:46:49.629 --> 00:46:51.496
And you're not a Knight.

00:46:52.832 --> 00:46:55.066
Only a butcher's boy.

00:46:55.101 --> 00:46:58.136
That was my lady's sister
you were hitting, do you know that?

00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:00.505
- Stop it!
- Arya, stay out of this.

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:03.208
I won't hurt him...

00:47:03.242 --> 00:47:04.843
Much.

00:47:13.352 --> 00:47:14.619
Arya!

00:47:15.621 --> 00:47:17.022
Filthy little bitch!

00:47:17.056 --> 00:47:18.957
No no, stop it, stop it,
both of you.

00:47:18.991 --> 00:47:22.327
You're spoiling it.
You're spoiling everything!

00:47:22.361 --> 00:47:24.996
I'll gut you,
you little cunt!

00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:29.801
- Arya!
- Nymeria!

00:47:29.835 --> 00:47:32.404
- Arya!
- Nymeria!

00:47:37.276 --> 00:47:39.210
No.

00:47:39.245 --> 00:47:41.846
No.
Please don't.

00:47:41.881 --> 00:47:44.315
Arya, leave him alone.

00:48:02.902 --> 00:48:06.371
My prince, my poor prince,
look what they did to you.

00:48:06.405 --> 00:48:08.840
Stay here, I'll go back
to the inn and bring help.

00:48:08.874 --> 00:48:10.208
Then go!

00:48:12.011 --> 00:48:14.446
Don't touch me.

00:48:16.449 --> 00:48:19.417
<i>The wolf's not here.
Look down by the stream.</i>

00:48:25.424 --> 00:48:29.394
You've got to go. They'll kill you for
what you did to Joffrey.

00:48:29.428 --> 00:48:31.563
Go on-- run.

00:48:34.667 --> 00:48:36.835
Go!
Leave now!

00:48:38.938 --> 00:48:41.406
- <i>It's a direwolf.</i>
- <i>I'll check down here.</i>

00:48:46.979 --> 00:48:50.582
<i>I think I heard a noise.</i>

00:48:52.151 --> 00:48:53.785
<i>Go!</i>

00:49:05.765 --> 00:49:08.900
<i>Arya!</i>

00:49:08.934 --> 00:49:13.638
- Distant man: <i>Arya!</i>
- Ned: <i>Arya!</i>

00:49:13.672 --> 00:49:16.574
<i>Arya-aa!</i>

00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:19.778
Arya!

00:49:19.812 --> 00:49:21.546
<i>Arya!</i>

00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:23.515
My lord!

00:49:23.549 --> 00:49:25.950
My lord!
They found her.

00:49:25.985 --> 00:49:28.453
She's unharmed.

00:49:28.487 --> 00:49:30.005
Where is she?

00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:31.756
She's been taken
directly before the King.

00:49:31.811 --> 00:49:33.645
- Who took her?
- The Lannisters found her.

00:49:33.921 --> 00:49:36.089
- <i>Arya-aa!</i>
- Right, get back.

00:49:36.159 --> 00:49:38.539
<i>The Queen ordered</i>
<i>them to bring her straight to him.</i>

00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:40.995
Back!
Back to the inn.

00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:43.067
All back!

00:49:50.709 --> 00:49:52.577
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

00:49:52.611 --> 00:49:54.345
<i>- Are you hurt?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:56.915
Oh, it's all right.

00:49:58.617 --> 00:50:01.352
What is
the meaning of this?

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:04.139
Why was my daughter
not brought to me at once?

00:50:04.513 --> 00:50:06.153
How dare you speak
to your King in that manner?

00:50:06.178 --> 00:50:07.378
Quiet, woman.

00:50:08.327 --> 00:50:11.229
Sorry, Ned.
I never meant to frighten the girl.

00:50:11.263 --> 00:50:13.531
But we need to get
this business done quickly.

00:50:13.599 --> 00:50:17.168
Your girl and that butcher's boy
attacked my son.

00:50:17.203 --> 00:50:19.838
That animal of hers
nearly tore his arm off.

00:50:19.872 --> 00:50:21.806
That's not true!

00:50:21.841 --> 00:50:24.309
She just...
Bit him a little.

00:50:24.343 --> 00:50:27.946
- He was hurting Mycah.
- Joff told us what happened.

00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:29.881
You and that boy
beat him with clubs

00:50:29.915 --> 00:50:32.784
- while you set your wolf on him.
- That's not what happened!

00:50:32.818 --> 00:50:34.444
Yes it is!

00:50:34.469 --> 00:50:36.219
They all attacked me and she
threw my sword in the river.

00:50:36.222 --> 00:50:37.488
- Liar!
- Shut up!

00:50:37.523 --> 00:50:38.923
<i>Enough!</i>

00:50:38.958 --> 00:50:41.993
He tells me one thing,
she tells me another.

00:50:42.027 --> 00:50:44.395
Seven hells!
What am I to make of this?

00:50:46.465 --> 00:50:48.523
Where's your
other daughter, Ned?

00:50:48.548 --> 00:50:49.900
In bed asleep.

00:50:50.363 --> 00:50:51.664
She's not.

00:50:52.556 --> 00:50:54.891
Sansa, come here, darling.

00:51:04.850 --> 00:51:06.851
Now, child...

00:51:07.753 --> 00:51:09.821
Tell me what happened.

00:51:09.855 --> 00:51:11.923
Tell it all
and tell it true.

00:51:11.957 --> 00:51:14.592
It's a great crime
to lie to a King.

00:51:23.002 --> 00:51:24.936
I don't know.

00:51:24.970 --> 00:51:28.406
I don't remember.
Everything happened so fast.

00:51:29.308 --> 00:51:31.776
- I didn't see.
- Liar!

00:51:31.810 --> 00:51:33.278
- Liar liar liar!
- Arya!

00:51:33.312 --> 00:51:35.613
- Hey, stop it! That's enough of that.
- Liar liar liar!

00:51:35.648 --> 00:51:40.009
- Stop! Arya!
- She's as wild as that animal of hers.

00:51:40.086 --> 00:51:41.107
<i>I want her punished.</i>

00:51:41.108 --> 00:51:43.840
What would you have me do,
whip her through the streets?

00:51:44.362 --> 00:51:47.064
Damn it, children fight.
It's over.

00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:49.702
Joffrey will bear these scars
for the rest of his life.

00:51:51.371 --> 00:51:55.007
You let that
little girl disarm you?

00:52:01.014 --> 00:52:04.150
Ned, see to it that
your daughter is disciplined.

00:52:04.184 --> 00:52:07.053
- I'll do the same with my son.
- Gladly, your Grace.

00:52:08.288 --> 00:52:10.923
And what of the direwolf?

00:52:10.958 --> 00:52:13.559
What of the beast
that savaged your son?

00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:18.931
I'd forgot
the damned wolf.

00:52:18.966 --> 00:52:21.734
We found no trace
of the direwolf, your Grace.

00:52:21.768 --> 00:52:25.037
No?
So be it.

00:52:25.072 --> 00:52:27.240
We have another wolf.

00:52:30.544 --> 00:52:32.178
As you will.

00:52:32.212 --> 00:52:35.414
- You can't mean it.
- A direwolf's no pet.

00:52:35.449 --> 00:52:37.884
Get her a dog.
She'll be happier for it.

00:52:39.019 --> 00:52:41.387
He doesn't mean Lady,
does he?

00:52:41.421 --> 00:52:44.423
No no, not lady!
Lady didn't bite anyone!

00:52:44.458 --> 00:52:46.359
- She's good!
- Lady wasn't there!

00:52:46.393 --> 00:52:49.762
- <i>You leave her alone!</i>
- Stop them. Don't let them do it.

00:52:49.830 --> 00:52:52.565
Please please,
it wasn't Lady!

00:52:52.599 --> 00:52:54.100
Is this your command--

00:52:55.168 --> 00:52:56.702
your Grace?

00:53:03.110 --> 00:53:06.646
- Where is the beast?
- Chained up outside, your Grace.

00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:08.848
Ser Ilyn,
do me the honor.

00:53:08.882 --> 00:53:11.183
No.

00:53:11.218 --> 00:53:13.586
Jory...

00:53:14.688 --> 00:53:16.722
Take the girls
to their rooms.

00:53:20.928 --> 00:53:23.529
If it must be done,

00:53:23.563 --> 00:53:25.531
then I'll do it myself.

00:53:25.565 --> 00:53:27.767
Is this some trick?

00:53:27.801 --> 00:53:30.736
The wolf is of the north.

00:53:30.771 --> 00:53:33.873
She deserves better
than a butcher.

00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:09.175
The butcher's boy--

00:54:09.242 --> 00:54:10.910
you rode him down?

00:54:10.944 --> 00:54:13.079
He ran...

00:54:13.113 --> 00:54:14.814
Not very fast.

00:55:45.329 --> 00:55:49.329
